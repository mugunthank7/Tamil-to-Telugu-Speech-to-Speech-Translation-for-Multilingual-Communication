## Abstract
The growing demand for effective cross-lingual communication highlights the importance of speech-to-speech (S2S) translation technologies. These systems have enormous promise, especially in multilingual countries like India, which has 22 official languages, including Tamil and Telugu. This project focuses on developing a Tamil-to-Telugu S2S translation model that includes three key components: Speech-to-Text (STT), Text Translation (TT), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) modules.

## Conclusion
The development of a robust Tamil-to-Telugu Speech-to-Speech (S2S) translation system has shown significant promise in overcoming language barriers and facilitating effective multilingual communication. By leveraging the Whisper ASR model for Speech-to-Text (STT), we achieved a notable reduction in Word Error Rate (WER), demonstrating the model's efficiency in handling Tamil speech inputs. The transformer-based Text Translation (TT) model ensured accurate and contextually appropriate translations from Tamil to Telugu, achieving a high BLEU score of 0.57 and a Cosine Similarity of 0.69597. The final Text-to-Speech (TTS) phase, utilizing the VITS-based MMS model, produced natural and intelligible Telugu speech, closely approximating human speech quality with a MOS score of 4.43.

This integrated S2S translation pipeline represents a significant advancement in the field of low-resource language processing, particularly for Dravidian languages. The system's ability to handle noisy environments and maintain high accuracy across all translation phases highlights its potential for real-world applications. Future work will focus on further refining the translation models, expanding the dataset to include more diverse speech samples, and exploring end-to-end S2S translation approaches to enhance system efficiency and performance.

Our research underscores the importance of continuous innovation and adaptation of state-of-the-art technologies to address the unique challenges posed by multilingual communication in diverse linguistic landscapes. By enhancing the accessibility and usability of S2S systems, we aim to contribute to a more inclusive and connected world, where language differences no longer impede effective communication.
